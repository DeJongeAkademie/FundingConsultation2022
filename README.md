# DJA Funding Consultation <a href='https://dejongeakademie.nl/en/projects/2150102.aspx'><img src='material/logo_collective_compass.png' align="right" height="139" /></a>

<!-- Please add a brief introduction to explain what the project is about    -->

This consultation relates to science funding, a topic that affects all academics in the Netherlands. At present, discussions are taking place about possible funding reforms, which trigger strongly polarized responses. If we would address all academics in the Netherlands and ask them to weigh their preferences on this matter, what insights would result? By joining forces, we wish to create an evidence-based collective signal that can better inform our policymakers.

The Young Academy has adopted the participatory value evaluation method (PVE). In the PVE, participants are faced with the dilemmas and limitations that policymakers face, and have to propose solutions within the constraints imposed. This method has been developed by fellow researchers and has successfully been applied in large-scale citizen consultations on topics that spark fierce societal debate, such as the relaxation of coronavirus measures.

# Reproducibility

This project aspires to follow the Workflow for Open Reproducible Code in Science (WORCS) to
ensure transparency and reproducibility. The [workflow](https://psyarxiv.com/k4wde/) is designed by 
[Van Lissa et al](10.31234/osf.io/k4wde)  to meet the
principles of Open Science throughout a research project. 

To learn how WORCS helps researchers meet the TOP-guidelines and FAIR principles,
read the preprint at https://osf.io/zcvbs/
