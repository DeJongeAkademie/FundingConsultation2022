# Introduction

Research funding is a hot topic in the Dutch academic landscape. Some argue that allocating financial resources through competition guarantees emergence of the best ideas and excellent science. Others warn that the current system sustains unhealthy and counterproductive competition and repels young talents from the academic career path. Almost everyone agrees that researchers are spending too much time preparing applications.

What is the right answer? Should more funds be directed to the so-called first stream, allocated directly to the universities to fund continuous research efforts (‘rolling grants’)? Will transferring the allocation task from one agency (NWO) to another (universities) result in a fairer and more efficient system? What should determine the balance between these sources, and is there a unique answer for various disciplinary sections, different career stages, and different academic roles? 

With this consultation you, the academic, take on the role of policy maker. You are presented with a range of options and can assess the impact of the choices you make. By recording the views of academics of all career stages and disciplines, the results of this consultation will show to policy makers, university boards, and funding agencies how various communities of Dutch academia, in their broad diversity, see the future of research funding in The Netherlands.

# The funding distriubtion options

This is the main part of the consultation. Here, we ask you to express your policy choices by distributing the research budget among a series of funding instruments. You can choose 11 options.
This model is very much simplified, since our primary goal is to understand the priorities of participants and their communities. Here you can find a full description of this model.
You can get summarized information about the idea behind the different funding instruments and about the implications of each choice by clicking the Info buttons. 
Use the sliders to distribute the money across the funding instruments. How would you distribute 550 million Euros a year for scientific research? 
After you have made your choices, you can motivate them on the next page.
	
## Funding options

### A: Competitive grants for an individual (senior) principal investigator (PI)

Personal grants such as the innovation impulse scheme are highly competitive grants. In this model we assume an average success rate of 15%, because there is a fixed number of people who qualify (because of age, previous attempts, pre-proposals). `kt_personal_senior`

_Potential Advantage_
+ Grant proposals pass through an elaborate screening process, and only those that are deemed excellent will be granted.

_Potential downside_
+ The screening process has substantial overhead and many proposals that go through this screening are not granted. 
+ Writing each granted or ungranted proposal and the screening process also will take an estimated 4 weeks of work per proposal (0.1 FTE). 

### B: Competitive grants for teams of 2 or more principal investigators (PI)
	
These team grants (2 or 3 Principal Investigators) are competitive grants that encourage collaborations. The pre-conditions for participation (previous attempts, pre-proposals) determine the success rate. In this model we assume an average success rate of 30%. `kt_team`

_Potential advantage_
+ Grant proposals pass through an elaborate screening process, and only those that are deemed excellent will be granted. In comparison with personal grants, team grants are estimated to have a smaller overhead and larger success rate.

_Potential disadvantage_
+ Many proposals that go through this screening are not granted. 
+ Writing each granted or ungranted proposal and the screening process also will take an estimated 2 weeks of work for the main applicant (0.05 FTE-year).

### C: Competitive individual grants for recently graduated PhD students

Personal entry-level grants such as the innovation impulse scheme are highly competitive grants. With the current size of the applicant pool and conditions set on the applicants, the success rate stays around 15%. `kt_personal_ecr`

_Potential advantage_
+ Applicants with demonstrated performance much higher than the average improve their chances at securing an academic position.

_Potential disadvantage_
+ The screening process has substantial overhead and many proposals that go through this screening are not granted.
+ high workload:  Writing each granted or ungranted proposal and the screening process  also will take an estimate of 4 weeks of work per proposal (0.1 FTE).

### D: Thematic research by a consortium without in-cash co-funding
	
Consortia of researchers can submit research proposals to NWO. Participation in consortia is a highly demanding preparation process. However, consortia are capable of handling larger problems and generate a high impact. With the current size of the applicant pool and conditions set on the application process, the success rate stays around 20%. `kt_thematic`

_Potential advantage_
+ Only research proposals with excellent reviews and outstanding teams will be granted. Large societal problems and scientific challenges will be addressed by these consortia.

_Potential disadvantage_
+ Setting up consortia that can meet the conditions for participation is a tough and long process. 
+ Writing this type of grant takes, for every created research position, an estimate of 4 weeks of work (0.1 FTE)

### E: Thematic research by a consortium with in-cash co-funding 
	
Consortia of researchers can submit research proposals to NWO. Participation in consortia is a highly demanding preparation process. Public-private partnerships are generating a direct societal impact. 
With the current size of the applicant pool and conditions set on the application process, the success rate is around 30%, which is higher than similar consortia without co-funding. `kt_thematic_co`
	
_Potential advantage_
+ Only research proposals with excellent reviews and outstanding teams will be granted. Large societal problems and scientific challenges will be addressed by these consortia.
+ Extra funding from the non-government sectors increases the total amount of funding available for research.

_Potential disadvantage_
+ Setting up consortia that can meet the conditions for submission is a tough and long process. Partnerships with the private sector are at risk of generating conflicts of interest.
+ Workload: Writing this type of grant takes, for every created research position, an estimate of 4 weeks of work (0.1 FTE).

### F: Small grants (50k-100k) distributed through the universities 
	
With smaller grants, more proposals can be granted. This will also attract a larger pool of applicants. By adjusting the conditions for participation, the success rate for these grants can be kept at around 50%. Universities determine their own process in distributing the grants. For these grants collaboration between different senior researchers is essential for financing a PhD position. `kt_small_first`

_Potential advantage_
+ The high success rate of these grants can provide opportunities for initiating smaller projects and for the sustainable continuation of existing research lines.
_Potential disadvantage_
+ The amounts are lower, so cannot be used to create stable research positions. 


### G: Smaller grants (50k-100k) distributed through NWO
	
With smaller grants, more proposals can be granted. This will also attract a larger pool of applicants. By adjusting the conditions for participation, the success rate for these grants can be kept at around 35%.	 `kt_small_second`

_Potential advantage_
+ The high success rate of these grants can provide opportunities for initiating smaller projects and for the sustainable continuation of existing research lines. 
+ Granting via NWO can give a higher chance for mobility of people. 

_Potential disadvantage_
+ The overhead of the review process by NWO is relatively higher than that by the universities.

### H: Major awards for achievements in science, education, or societal impact
	
Apart from financing proposals for future research, NWO can also award academics based on the major contributions they made in the past. Identifying and celebrating major scientific, educational and societal achievements can also  attract societal attention and support for science. Each award is high enough to support extensive research plans. `kt_award`
	
_Potential advantage_
+ Celebrating role models for young scientists and rewarding long term commitment to science, education and societal impact.
+ Academics who perform in an excellent way in science, education or societal impact, but who are not that good in writing research proposals have an opportunity to find funding for continuing their research lines.

_Potential disadvantage_
+ Only very few people will get these opportunities.

### I: Money to universities for extra positions with long-term perspective for starting researchers
	
More money is made available to universities for the creation of positions with long-term perspective for starting researchers. The positions are filled through hiring committees. Universities determine their own hiring strategy. `kt_first_ecr`
	
_Potential advantage_
+ Fewer temporary contracts. It is easier to attract and retain good researchers.
+ Increase in the probability of a permanent contract reduces stress.

_Potential disadvantage_
+ An increase in researchers with permanent contracts can decrease flexibility of universities to change their strategy..

### J: Direct funding of independent research for assistant and associate professors (rolling grant)
	
Assistant and associate professors with a permanent contract receive a budget from the university to perform independent research. 
Currently, there are about 6200 such staff members working in Dutch universities. Allocating the equivalent of 1 PhD position each 6 years, thus, will cost about 100 Million Euro per year. `kt_rolling_ecr`

_Potential advantages_
+ No time lost in writing grant applications.
+ Possibility to sustain research lines over a longer time. Possibility to hire support staff. 
+ Researchers are free to choose how to use these resources.

_Potential disadvantages_
+ Excellence is not guaranteed in the absence of competition. 
+ Acquiring funding becomes harder for people without a tenure track or permanent staff position.

### K: Direct funding of independent research for full professors (rolling grant)
	
Full professors receive a budget from the university to perform independent research. 
Currently, there are about 2800 full professors working at Dutch universities. Allocating the equivalent of 1 PhD position each 3 years, thus, will cost about 100 Million Euro per year. `kt_rolling_senior`

_Potential advantages_
+ No time lost in writing grant applications. 
+ Possibility to sustain research lines over a longer time. 
+ Possibility to hire support staff. Researchers are free to choose how to use these resources.

_Potential disadvantages_
+ Excellence is not guaranteed in the absence of competition. 
+ If only full professors are eligible for this, relatively speaking a smaller part of the academic community will be able to benefit from this.
