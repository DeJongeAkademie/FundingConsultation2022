## About this folder

The ``/clutter`` subfolder is a place to collect all the ambiguous or evidently unnecessary files in the repository before deleting them. 
The clutter folder will be cleaned up at monthly intervals. 

### Recommendation
+ Please check this folder first if you have lost some files, and if you cannot find it, create an issue.
+ If you are cleaning up part of the repository, you can dump unnecessary files into this folder.
