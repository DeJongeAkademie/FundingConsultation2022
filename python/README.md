For recreating the visualizations, the packages used are in the `DJA_consultation.yml` file. We made use of anaconda for this.

To create a local environment from this file, run:

``conda env create --name [YOUR_PREFERRED_ENVIRONMENT_NAME] -f DJA_consultation.yml``

then, to activate it, run

``conda activate [YOUR_PREFERRED_ENVIRONMENT_NAME]``

and to deactivate, you can use

``conda deactivate``
