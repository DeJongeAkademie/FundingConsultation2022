## About this folder

In the ``/results`` subfolder, we collect all the intermediate, or definitive, results that we want to share with the other collaborators. 

### Recommendation
+ If you are analysing data on your personal initiative, please put the results that you like to share in subfolder named by your github account. This will help others who have a question about a specific result to easily find the right person to ask.  
+ Please add a readme file, or update log to your subfolder.  
+ It can help others who are exploring the repository if you can clearly mark a few of your results which you think are the most interesting or people have to look at them first.
